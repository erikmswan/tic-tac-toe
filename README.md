# tic-tac-toe

An unfinished tic-tac-toe game. It will ultimately have both a local multiplayer and a 'singleplayer' against the computer. Since you can fairly trivially write a program that will never lose, I thought it would be neat to include a 'difficulty level' of easy, medium, and hard, where each mode would add a certain random chance that the computer does not make the correct move.

This was made in pure JavaScript -- no jQuery was used. This was done mostly for practice, but it also means it has no dependencies.

I'm especially proud of the responsiveness of this web app! It will fit any window size (within reason).
